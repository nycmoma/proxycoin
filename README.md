## A simple concept of Amnesia Network

It's a distributed anonimous network (concept is expected to be simplier than tor/i2p protocols) that don't have any logs by design, where clients use tokens to transfer data, and validator nodes (which are also exit nodes) are getiing tokens for transferred data. I expect that simple paranoid conversations will be cheap, and data stealing - very expensive.
